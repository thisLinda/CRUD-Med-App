## What Am I Looking At?

That's a brief glimpse of a modified barium swallow study (MBS), an instrumental evaluation of swallow function conducted by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) in conjunction with a radiologist.

As I transition from my career as an SLP in rehab to a full stack developer it is my intention to create apps to support SLPs in turn advancing my coding skills.

Swallow function can be impacted by medication and it's important to know if your patient has this added risk. My app is intended to be a quick source for an SLP to quickly review a patient's medications and identify those which impact swallow.

## About the Project
Promineo Tech Front-End Development Final Project. 

React Project Criteria:
- Use an online API or if no API found use an array for in-memory storage
- Use React Router and have at least 3 pages
- Use React Bootstrap or an alternative styling library 
- Contain at least 10 components
- Allow for all CRUD operations

## How I Can Improve this App
- Remove link to home page on home page.
- Refactor for mobile. "Mobile first" approach was not addressed in this course.
- Improve responsiveness.
- Address accessibility.
- Include testing.
- Find API and hook up search including search by both generic and brand names and by severity. One public API located, query strings have not returned the targeted information.
- Add field for degree of severity.
- Display > 1 adverse reaction/severity.
- Styling.

## Contributing
I worked independently and with mentors to create a query [here](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/example-api-queries/) and we were unsuccessful.
