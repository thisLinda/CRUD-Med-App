## What Am I Looking At?
That's a modified barium swallow study (MBS), an instrumental evaluation of swallow function conducted by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) in conjunction with a radiologist.

As I transition from my career as an SLP in rehab to a full stack developer I can both fulfill my intention to create and distribute apps to support SLPs as I advance my coding skill.

Swallow function can be impacted by medication and it's important to know if your patient has this added risk. This app is intended to be a quick source for the SLP to identify those medications which impact swallow and create a personal list if desired.

## About the Project
Promineo Tech Front-End Development Final Project. 

React Project Criteria:
- Use an online API or if no API found use an array for in-memory storage
- Use React Router and have at least 3 pages
- Use React Bootstrap or an alternative styling library 
- Contain at least 10 components
- Allow for all CRUD operations

## How I Can Improve this App
- Remove link to home page on home page.
- Refactor for mobile. "Mobile first" approach was not addressed in this course.
- Improve responsiveness.
- Address accessibility.
- Include testing.
- Find API and hook up search including search by both generic and brand names and by severity. One public API located, query strings have not returned the targeted information.
- Add field for degree of severity.
- Display > 1 adverse reaction/severity.
- Improve styling.

## Contributing
I worked independently and with mentors to create a query [here](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/example-api-queries/) and we were unsuccessful. This app will only be an asset to a clinician with the ability to access the database. DM me on Twitter, check my bio here if you have any suggestions.
